# pet-clinic
My version of Pet Clinic app using Spring Boot. Done while completing Spring Framework Guru course on udemy.

Applied SOLID principles building the project

Used Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA

Added both an in memory hashmap and a h2 detabase implementation.

Used project lombok to generate getters, setters, create the equalas and hascode methods, eliminating some boilerplate code
